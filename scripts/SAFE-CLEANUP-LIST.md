```

### ‚úÖ ALSO SAFE TO DELETE - Renamed Package
```
homelabarr-dockupdate   (renamed to homelabarr-hlupdater)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è For Current homelabarr-* Packages - SELECTIVE Cleanup

For packages starting with `homelabarr-`, only delete these TAGS:
- Tags starting with `v-` followed by 7 characters (SHA tags like `v-8b2a645`)
- Untagged manifests older than 7 days
- Any `main` branch tags (old format)

### üõë DO NOT DELETE These Tags on homelabarr-* packages:
- `latest`
- `v1.0.0`
- `v1.0`
- `v1`
- `buildcache`
- `dev` (if exists)
- `nightly` (if exists)

### üö´ DO NOT TOUCH - Non-HomelabARR Packages
Leave ALL other packages that don't match the patterns above completely alone, including:
- Any personal projects
- Any other tools/utilities
- Anything not in the lists above

## Safe Cleanup Commands

### Option 1: Web UI (Safest)
1. Go to https://github.com/smashingtags?tab=packages
2. ONLY click on packages listed above
3. Delete entire package for `docker-*` ones
4. For `homelabarr-*` packages, only delete old SHA tags

### Option 2: CLI (Be Very Careful)
```bash
# List packages to verify what you have
gh api /user/packages?package_type=container --paginate | jq '.[].name' | sort

# For each OLD docker-* package listed above:
PACKAGE="docker-alpine"  # Replace with package from list
gh api /user/packages/container/$PACKAGE/versions --paginate
# Then delete the entire package if it's in the safe list

# For homelabarr-* packages, be selective about tags
PACKAGE="homelabarr-plex"
gh api /user/packages/container/$PACKAGE/versions --paginate | jq '.[] | select(.metadata.container.tags[] | startswith("v-")) | .id'
# Only delete SHA-based tags, not version tags
```

## Summary Checklist

- [ ] Wait for builds to complete
- [ ] Delete ALL `docker-*` packages from the list above (35 total)
- [ ] Delete `homelabarr-dockupdate` package
- [ ] For `homelabarr-*` packages: ONLY delete SHA tags (v-xxxxxxx)
- [ ] Keep all version tags (latest, v1.0.0, v1.0, v1)
- [ ] Don't touch ANY other packages not listed here

## Verification
After cleanup, you should have:
- ‚úÖ All `homelabarr-*` packages with clean version tags
- ‚úÖ No old `docker-*` HomelabARR packages
- ‚úÖ All your other non-HomelabARR packages untouched
